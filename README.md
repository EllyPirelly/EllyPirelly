## Hi, I'm EllyPirelly ðŸ‘‹

I'm a fulltime Frontend Developer at Berlin-based [3pc GmbH](https://3pc.de/en/).

Previously, I've worked at Oetker Digital and Zalando.

With my background of 26 years in print media as digital media designer, image editor and proof reader, I'm working on and improving in merging the digital and physical world - to turn things into semantic HTML and subjectively pretty (S)CSS.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on transfering my static portfolio page to Vue 3
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Vue 3 and trying to get better in all basics - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can clap my hands really loud - and I mean _really_ loud!
