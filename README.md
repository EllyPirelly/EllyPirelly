## Hi, I'm Elle ðŸ‘‹

### :open_book: About me
I'm a Berlin-based Frontend Engineer | Pronouns: she/her

Being on my way to Full Stack Web Developer, I love working on the web in taking my previous experience of 26 years as a digital media designer (print), and merging it with my now digital one. <br>

Working with stakeholders of all backgrounds â€“ being it the German government, a traditional business that has been founded in 1891, or a huge German online retailer â€“ I enjoy helping to identify customer pain points, bridging gaps through transparent communication and delivering solutions. <br>

Deeply curious, I love learning and finding out "how things work". <br>
Throwing something I've built in a browser sometimes still seems like magic :magic_wand: to me. <br>

### :arrow_upper_right: What I'm up to
:hammer_and_wrench: Currently ongoing is the development of features for my recently launched portfolio site which has been built in Statamic CMS. <br>
ðŸŒ± Always expanding my knowledge, a deeper understanding of JavaScript, React, PHP and a11y are next on my list. <br>
âš¡ Fun fact: I can clap my hands really loud - and I mean _really_ loud! <br>
