## Hi, I'm EllyPirelly ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Berlin-based Frontend Engineer | Pronouns: she/her :smile:

Previously, I've worked at 3pc GmbH, Oetker Digital and Zalando SE.

With my background of 26 years in print media as digital media designer, image editor and proof reader, I'm working on and improving in merging the digital and physical world to create accessible products and web applications. <br>

:computer: Currently I'm working on redesigning the first draft of my very static and simple portfolio site in Figma, then relaunching it in Statamic CMS. <br>
ðŸ”­ My next specific learning goal is getting better at a11y. For this I've pre-ordered Sara Soueidan's https://practical-accessibility.today/ course and cannot wait to start with it! <br>
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always trying to get better in the basics - HTML, CSS, JavaScript <br>
âš¡ Fun fact: I can clap my hands really loud - and I mean _really_ loud! <br>
