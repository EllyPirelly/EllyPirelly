## Hello, I'm Elle ðŸ‘‹

### :open_book: About me
As a bi-lingual Frontend Engineer passionate about Full-Stack development, I take great pleasure in merging my previous experience of 2+ decades as a digital media designer print with my now digital one. <br>
First fiddling around with HTML and CSS wayyyyyy back in the days while trying to customize my Myspace page (do you remember MySpace Tom?!), I am hooked ever since. <br>
Up until today, throwing something I've built in a browser sometimes still seems like magic :magic_wand: to me. <br>
Enthusiastic about building performant, accessible, user-centric web applications my tech stack includes HTML, S/CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, ... and more. <br>
Lately, I had the privilege to pursue a dream of mine and to work on several Full-Stack projects, acquiring a vast amount of additional knowledge. Please find those projects as repositories on here. <br>
In the past I've worked at 3pc GmbH, Oetker Digital GmbH and Zalando SE, and contributed in helping to identify customer pain points and to build impactful digital solutions. <br>
Design-conscious and detail-oriented, I am highly organized and an empathic, clear communicator and steady learner. 

### :arrow_upper_right: What I'm up to
:hammer_and_wrench: Currently ongoing is the development of features for my recently launched portfolio site, built in Statamic CMS. Most prominently I want to introduce a blog section. <br>
ðŸŒ± Always expanding my knowledge: JavaScript, React.js, Statamic/PHP, a11y, ... <br>
âš¡ Fun fact: I can clap my hands really loud - and I mean _really_ loud! <br>
