## Hi, I'm Elle ðŸ‘‹

### :open_book: About me
I'm a Berlin-based Frontend Engineer and I build things for the web | Pronouns: she/her <br>

As a bi-lingual Frontend Engineer with a growing passion for Full-Stack development, I take great pleasure in merging my previous experience of 26 years as a digital media designer print with my now digital one. <br>

First fiddling around with HTML and CSS wayyyyyy back in the days while trying to customize my MySpace page (do you remember Tom?!), I am hooked ever since. Up until today, throwing something I've built in a browser sometimes still seems like magic :magic_wand: to me. <br>

In the past I've worked at 3pc GmbH, Oetker Digital GmbH and Zalando SE, and contributed in helping to identify customer pain points and to build impactful digital solutions. <br>

Lately, I had the privilege to pursue a dream of mine and to work on several Full-Stack projects. As a proud alumni of CareerFoundry's Full-Stack Web Development Program I acquired a vast amount of additional knowledge in JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, ... and a lot more!
Please find those projects as repositories on here.

Being a career-changer late in live, who has a deep curiosity in their DNA, I love learning and to find out how things work. So in my spare time I for example do things like a Figma course on Udemy, to efficiently redesign my very first, very old portfolio site. Since then it's relaunched with Statamic CMS. <br>

When I'm not at the computer, I'm usually hanging out with my husband and our very senior cats Peaches and Simon, strolling around in a museum or gallery, getting my socks rocked of at a concert or maybe even running one of the amazing races we have in Berlin. <br>

### :arrow_upper_right: What I'm up to
:hammer_and_wrench: Currently ongoing is the development of features for my recently launched portfolio site which has been built in Statamic CMS. <br>
ðŸŒ± Always expanding my knowledge: JavaScript, React.js, Statamic/PHP, a11y, ... <br>
âš¡ Fun fact: I can clap my hands really loud - and I mean _really_ loud! <br>
