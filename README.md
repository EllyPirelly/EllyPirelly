## Hi, I'm EllyPirelly ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Berlin-based Frontend Engineer.

Previously, I've worked at 3pc GmbH, Oetker Digital and Zalando SE.

With my background of 26 years in print media as digital media designer, image editor and proof reader, I'm working on and improving in merging the digital and physical world - to turn things into semantic HTML and subjectively pretty (S)CSS.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always trying to get better in all basics - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- ðŸ”­ My next specific learning goal is getting better at a11y. For this I've pre-ordered Sara Soueidan's https://practical-accessibility.today/ course and cannot wait to start with it!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can clap my hands really loud - and I mean _really_ loud!
