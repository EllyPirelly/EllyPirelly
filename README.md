## Hello, I'm Elle ðŸ‘‹

### :open_book: About me
As a bi-lingual Frontend Engineer with a growing passion for Full-Stack development, I take great pleasure in merging my previous experience of 26 years as a digital media designer print with my now digital one. <br>
First fiddling around with HTML and CSS wayyyyyy back in the days while trying to customize my MySpace page (do you remember Tom?!), I am hooked ever since. Up until today, throwing something I've built in a browser sometimes still seems like magic :magic_wand: to me. <br>

In the past I've worked at 3pc GmbH, Oetker Digital GmbH and Zalando SE, and contributed in helping to identify customer pain points and to build impactful digital solutions. <br>
Lately, I had the privilege to pursue a dream of mine and to work on several Full-Stack projects, acquiring a vast amount of additional knowledge in JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, ... and a lot more! Please find those projects as repositories on here.

### :arrow_upper_right: What I'm up to
:hammer_and_wrench: Currently ongoing is the development of features for my recently launched portfolio site which has been built in Statamic CMS, most prominently, I want a blog section. <br>
ðŸŒ± Always expanding my knowledge: JavaScript, React.js, Statamic/PHP, a11y, ... <br>
âš¡ Fun fact: I can clap my hands really loud - and I mean _really_ loud! <br>
